# Minitar
This project is a simplified version of the tar utility, called minitar

The tar utility was originally developed back in the era of widespread archival storage on magnetic tapes – tar is in fact short for “tape archive.” Therefore, archive files created by tar have a very simple format that is easy to read and write sequentially.

While minitar doesn't replicate the full functionality of the original tar utility, it is still quite capable. It allows you to create to create archives from files, modify existing archives, and extract the original files back from an archive.

Minitar is fully Posix-compliant, meaning it can freely interoperate with all of the standard tape-archive utility programs like the original tar. In other words, minitar is able to read and manipulate archives generated by tar, and vice versa.
